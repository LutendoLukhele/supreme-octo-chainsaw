Your task is to analyze the user's request and the list of available tools, then create a structured execution plan. Any pre-identified tool calls are provided as additional context to help you, but your primary task is to create a plan based on the user's overall goal and the tools at your disposal.

User's Request:
{{USER_CURRENT_MESSAGE}} // The original user message or the input provided to the planner tool

Pre-identified Tool Calls (if any, verify and integrate these):
{{PRE_IDENTIFIED_TOOLS_SECTION}}

Available Tools (use the exact 'name' property from this list for the 'tool' field in your plan):
{{TOOL_DEFINITIONS_JSON}}

Instructions:
1.  Identify all distinct actions or goals implied by the user's request, using the "Available Tools" list to determine feasible steps. Consider the "Pre-identified Tool Calls" as suggestions you should verify and integrate if they align with the user's request and available tools.
2.  For each action:
    a.  Assign a unique string ID (e.g., "action_1", "fetch_deals_task", "email_summary_step").
    b.  Write a user-friendly "intent" that describes the goal of this specific action in a narrative way. It should be clear to a non-technical user what this step is trying to accomplish. For example, instead of "Execute SendMessage", use "Draft and send an email summarizing the deal's progress to the primary contact."
    c.  Select the most appropriate "tool" from the "Available Tools" list.
    d.  Extract or determine the "arguments" for the tool. If arguments were pre-identified, verify them.
    e.  Determine the "status":
        - "ready": If all *required* parameters for the chosen tool are present and valid based *only* on the user's message and pre-identified arguments.
        - "conditional": If any *required* parameters are missing or need clarification.
    f.  If "status" is "conditional", list the names of the missing *required* parameters in "requiredParams" (an array of strings).

Output Format:
You MUST output a single JSON object. This object must have a key named "plan", and the value of "plan" must be an array of action objects.
Each action object in the "plan" array must strictly follow this format:
{
  "id": "string",
  "intent": "string",
  "tool": "string",
  "arguments": { /* JSON object of arguments */ },
  "status": "ready" | "conditional",
  "requiredParams": ["string"] // Only if status is "conditional"
}

Example Output:
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "intent": "Fetch all active deals",
      "tool": "FetchEntity",
      "arguments": { "entity": "Deal", "filter": { "status": "active" } },
      "status": "ready"
    },
    {
      "id": "2",
      "intent": "Send message to top contacts from active deals",
      "tool": "SendMessage",
      "arguments": { "recipientSource": "activeDealsContacts" },
      "status": "conditional",
      "requiredParams": ["messageContent"]
    }
  ]
}

If no actions can be planned, output: { "plan": [] }
Output only the JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown.
